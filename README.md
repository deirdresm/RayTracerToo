#  RayTracerToo

I'd previously written a good chunk of the [Ray Tracer Challenge](https://pragprog.com/titles/jbtracer/the-ray-tracer-challenge/) in Swift, but realized my C++ skills had atrophied as well as the language had moved on.

So, hence this project.

Test cases are in XCTest in Obj-C, mostly directly translated from the Swift versions (which were written to match the [Gherkin test descriptions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cucumber_(software)) found in the book.
